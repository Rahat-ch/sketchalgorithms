## ðŸš€ Quick start for Running

1.  **Running on your local machine.**
    
    Paste the command below into your terminal:
    
    ```git clone https://github.com/Rahat-ch/sketchalgorithms.git```
    
    Run one of the following commands to install all dependencies:
    
    ```npm install```
    
    or 
    
    ```yarn add```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd my-blog-starter/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-blog-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
