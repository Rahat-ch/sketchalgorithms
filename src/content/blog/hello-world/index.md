This is my first post on my new fake blog! How exciting!

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.

Oh, and here's a great quote from this Wikipedia on
[salted duck eggs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg).

> A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
> eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian
> supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted
> charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
> wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
> salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
> firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import Highlight, { defaultProps } from 'prism-react-renderer'

export const Code = ({ codeString, language, ...props }) => {
    return (
      <Highlight {...defaultProps} code={codeString} language={language}>
        {({ className, style, tokens, getLineProps, getTokenProps }) => (
          <pre className={className} style={style}>
            {tokens.map((line, i) => (
              <div {...getLineProps({ line, key: i })}>
                {line.map((token, key) => (
                  <span {...getTokenProps({ token, key })} />
                ))}
              </div>
            ))}
          </pre>
        )}
      </Highlight>
    )
  }
}
